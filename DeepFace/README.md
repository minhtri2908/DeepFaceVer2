# DeepFace

## Introduction
Open source implementation of the renowned publication titled ["DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification"](https://research.fb.com/publications/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/) by Yaniv Taigman, Ming Yang, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Lior Wolf published at [Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/menu.py) 2014.

Implementation of this paper have been done using Keras ([tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)). This project and necessary research was supported by the [TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc). [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) resources have been used to train a million-scale machine learning model using [Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/).
